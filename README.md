Red velvet cake is the queen of all layer cakes. The “I can’t quite put my finger on the flavor” cake. 
It’s the sweet mixture of buttermilk and vanilla with a little cocoa for good measure.
It's tall, dramatic, and completely covered in silky cream cheese frosting. This is fav red velvet cake.
 It’s dense and soft with a moist and velvety crumb. However, the absolute best part about red velvet cake is the cream cheese frosting. Slathered on thick, it’s cream cheese frosting recipe is delicately sweet and undeniably creamy.
